# CHAPTER 1
## A short introduction to the CPU
The CPU is a device that executes the machine code a program consists of.

**INSTRUCTION** :   A primitive CPU command that exectes a predefined function.

**ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE**   :   It is a low level language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.

**CPU REGISTER**    :   It is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of the computer processor.

INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE (ISA)
An instruction set architecture defines the supported datatypes, the registers, the hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental deatures and the input/output of a family of implementations of the ISA. An ISA specifies the behaviour of the machine code running on implementation of that ISA in a fashion that does not depend on the characteristics of that implmentation providing binary compatibility between implementations.
